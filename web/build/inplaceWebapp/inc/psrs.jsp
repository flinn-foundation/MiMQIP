Is anyone going out of their way to give you a hard time, or trying to hurt you? Do you feel in any danger?

Include thought insertion, withdrawal and broadcast.

When rating degree to which functioning is disrupted by hallucinations, include preoccupation with the content and experience of the hallucinations, as well as functioning disrupted by acting out on the hallucinatory content (e.g., engaging in deviant behavior due to command hallucinations). Include "thoughts aloud" ("gedankenlautwerden") or pseudohallucinations (e.g., hears a voice inside head) if a voice quality is present.

				<span class="title">1. PROLONGED TIME TO RESPOND (a measure of Alogia):</span> 
				Observed throughout communication with the patient. After asking the patient a question, he or she pauses for inappropriately long periods before initiating a response. Delay is considered a pause if it feels as though you are waiting for a response or if you consider repeating the question because it appears that the patient has not heard you. He or she may seem "distant," and sometimes the examiner may wonder if he has even heard the question. Prompting usually indicates that the patient is aware of the question, but has been having difficulty in developing his thoughts in order to make an appropriate reply. Rate severity on the frequency of these pauses.

				<span class="title">3. REDUCED SOCIAL DRIVE (a measure of Asociality):</span> 
				This item assesses how much the subject desires to initiate social interactions. Desire may be measured in part by the number of actual or attempted social contacts with others. If the patient has frequent contact with someone (e.g., family member) who initiates the contact, does the patient appear to desire the contact (i.e., would he or she initiate contact if necessary?)? In making this rating, probe the desire to initiate social interactions, number of social interactions, and the ability to enjoy them.

				Observed during interaction with the patient. The patient displays less attention to grooming and hygiene than normal. The patient presents with poorly groomed hair, disheveled clothing, etc. Do not rate grooming as poor if it is simply done in what one might consider poor taste (e.g., wild hairdo or excessive makeup). In addition to observation, one must ask the patient about regularity of bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, etc. This is particularly important with outpatients, as the patient may present his or her best grooming and hygiene at their clinic visit. Two dimensions to keep in mind when making this rating are current appearance and regularity of grooming behaviors.
