This page should be a splash page with reference to <a href="http://www.flinnfoundation.org/">The Flinn Foundation</a>, any other supporters, and possibly a contact address for facilities (or individuals) seeking access.  I doubt it will ultimately have links for individual Facilities.  But, for now...

<!--
Flinn EHR Administration Facility:<br/>
<a href="/flinn"><%=request.getServerName()%>/flinn</a>
<br/><br/>
Sample Facility:<br/>

Please refer to the documentation you received for the beta test to determine the URL of your specific facility.

Thank you.
